  Abstract                 = {We calculated and measured the density distribution and cloud size of a trapped two-dimensional (2D) 6 Li Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance at low temperatures. Density distributions and cloud sizes were calculated for a wide range of interaction parameters using a local density approximation (LDA) and a zero-temperature equation of state obtained from quantum Monte Carlo simulations reported by Bertaina and Giorgini (2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 110403). We found that LDA predictions agree well with experimental measurements across a Feshbach resonance. Theoretical results for Tan's contact parameter in a trapped gas are reported here along with predictions for the static structure factor at large momentum which could be measured in future Bragg spectroscopy experiments on 2D Fermi gases.},

  Abstract                 = {The onset of quartetting, i.e. α-particle condensation, in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter is studied with the help of an in-medium modified four nucleon equation. It is found that at very low density quartetting wins over pairing, because of the strong binding of the α-particles. The critical temperature can reach values up to around 8 MeV. The disappearance of α-particles with increasing density, i.e. the Mott transition, is investigated. In finite nuclei the Hoyle state, that is the 0 2 + of 12 C is identified as an 'α-particle condensate' state. It is conjectured that such states also exist in heavier nα-nuclei, like 16 O, 20 Ne, etc. The sixth 0 + state in 16 O is proposed as an analogue to the Hoyle state. The Gross-Pitaevski equation is employed to make an estimate of the maximum number of α particles a condensate state can contain. Possible quartet condensation in other systems is discussed briefly.},
