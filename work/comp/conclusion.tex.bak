\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
As mentioned before one of the most important parts of the calculation is to have a good estimate for the trial wave function that is possible and inexpensive to calculate. So far I have implemented and tested a method for improving the trial wave function used in AFDMC calculation of nuclei and nuclear matter. I have done this by including independent pair quadratic terms in the correlation operatori which currently only has linear terms. The addition of these terms has caused the binding energy of ${}^{4}$He to increase and the binding energy of ${}^{16}$O to decrease. It has also caused the binding energy of SNM to decrease. It is puzzling that the energies for ${}^{16}$O and SNM decreased by so much. We did not expect a large decrease because calculations have been done with the constraint removed, which should yield nearly exact estimates as long as the calculation can be controlled, and the energies are not very different from when only the linear correlations are used. This indicates that either there is an error in the calculation with IP correlations or there is an error with the unconstrained calculation.

Another way to improve the trial wave function is to include more terms in the expansion of the exponential correlation operator. As we have learned from the IP expansion that we implemented, this would get computationally intractableas the number of particles gets large. Another alternative is to rewrite the correlation operator in terms of a Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation as is done with the spin-isospin dependent part of the propagator in section~\ref{sec:AFDMC}. Future work will be done to handle the correlation operators in this way. I will also be searching for additional ways to improve the trial wave function.
