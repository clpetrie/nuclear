\section{Alpha Particle Formation in Neutron Rich Matter}
\red{Include theory here and then talk about the results}
One of the triumphs of nuclear physics is the ability to describe properties of macroscopic systems such as neutron stars with microscopic interactions. Neutron stars have been studied extensively with QMC methods, including the nuclear EOS , the mass-radius relationship \cite{???}, the symmetry energy, and the hyperon problem \cite{lonardoni2015,gandolfi2017}.
