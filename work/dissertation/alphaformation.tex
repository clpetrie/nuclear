\section{Alpha Particle Formation in Neutron Rich Matter}
\red{Include theory here and then talk about the results}
One of the triumphs of nuclear physics is the ability to describe properties of macroscopic systems such as neutron stars with microscopic interactions. Neutron stars have been studied extensively with QMC methods from the nuclear EOS \cite{sarsa2003,gandolfi2014} to the hyperon problem \cite{lonardoni2015,gandolfi2018}. As the density of nuclear matter increases the choice of the 3N force becomes more important. However, for neutron crusts with densities only up to about 0.5$\rho_0$ the choice of 3N force is not as crucial, and NN forces alone can give good results. The outer crusts of neutron stars host atom nuclei in a degenerate bath of electrons. As the density increases the nuclear binding force will eventually give way to neutron drip and the remaining nuclei will be in a fluid of dripped neutrons \cite{}.
