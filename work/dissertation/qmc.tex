\section{Quantum Monte Carlo}
Many problems in nuclear physics involve a large number particles and a complecated interaction between the particles. The Schr\"odinger equation used to solve these problems then involves a large dimensional integral with a complicated integrand. This is unfeasible to solve using standard numerical methods. Quantum Monte Carlo was designed to tackle these problems by sampling the large dimensional integrals in a way that reduces the necessary computation while still converging to an accurate answer.
