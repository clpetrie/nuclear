\section*{Conclusion}
I conclusion, I have learned how to implement VMC and DMC methods and have applied these methods to the quantum harmonic oscillator as well as a similar $x^4$ potential. The ground state energies and wave functions that I obtained were close to the exact solutions for the harmonic oscillator. I have also learned the basics of the AFDMC method and have being working on understanding the existing code. Further work will include the addition of the extra terms in the trial wave function correlations. These additions will then be compared to the existing code for a variety of nuclear systems.
