\abstract{I have learned how to use Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for simple systems. I have applied these methods to both 1D and 3D harmonic oscillators, as well as systems with $x^4$ potentials. I was able to verify that my results agreed with the exact results for the harmonic oscillator systems. I have learned the basics of Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) and have described the additions that I plan to make to the existing AFDMC code.}
