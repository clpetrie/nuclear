\begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf \underline{Healing Distance:}} This concept was introduced in the paper ``Properties of Nuclear Matter" by Gomes {\it et al.} in 1958. If you have long distance properties that get ``wounded" by interactions at the short distance, the healing distance is the distance at which these effects are negligable. I'm still struggling to understand this in terms of healing distance used in the nuclear correlations.
