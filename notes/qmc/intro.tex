\section*{Introduction}
Here I will describe various Monte Carlo methods used in solving quantum many body systems. I will start by describing Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) which is the most basic, and then I will describe Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). DMC is difficult to do when spin and isospin are included so I will then describe a method used to make the spin and isospin sampling easier called Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC).
