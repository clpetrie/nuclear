These are notes on the light cluster calculations done by Cody Petrie. A more detailed discussion can be found in my dissertation. If you have questions about them please contact me at codypetrie89@gmail.com.

I did calculations with 14 neutrons + 2 protons as well as 2 neutrons + 2 protons and so there is raw data for each, the latter being labeled 2n2p.

Some of the pp pair correlation function calculations (gofrnp) didn't have enough data to resolve the low seperation peak and so I redid the calculations with a finer grid size. This data is found in the same directors in the subdirectory "fine".

For all gofrnp data the 14n2p data have no label and the 2n2p data are specifically labeled as 2n2p.

Some of the calculations optimized the same with both linear and IP correlations and so were only calculated once. Those were the following calculations
rho,     calculations
0.00075  14n and 14n2p
0.0015   14n
0.0025   14n2p
0.007    14n
